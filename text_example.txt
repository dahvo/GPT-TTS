I (19F) have a close friend, Amy (21F), who has a small dog that she refers to as her emotional support animal. I’m a huge animal lover and have no problem with pets in general, so when she asked if she could bring her dog over a few months ago for a small gathering, I was totally fine with it.

However, during that visit, her dog completely destroyed one of my couch cushions by chewing it up and also scratched the legs of my coffee table. Amy apologized, but she kind of brushed it off and said, "He’s still learning to behave in new environments." I didn’t push back too much because I know the dog is important to her, but I was pretty upset because it cost me quite a bit to replace the damaged items.

Fast forward to now, Amy asked if she could bring her dog to my place again for another get-together. I politely told her that I wasn’t comfortable with the dog coming this time because of what happened last time, and I don’t want any more of my furniture ruined.

Amy got really upset and said that I was being insensitive to her mental health needs. She insisted that she needs the dog with her at all times and that I’m making her feel excluded by not allowing the dog. I suggested that she leave the dog at home just for a couple of hours or that we meet somewhere else, but she said I’m being unreasonable.

Now, some of our mutual friends are saying I should let the dog come to keep the peace, but I don’t think it’s fair that I should risk more damage to my home.

AITA for refusing to let her bring her emotional support dog to my house again?
